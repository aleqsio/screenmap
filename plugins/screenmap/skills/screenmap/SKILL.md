description: Generate a visual navigation map of an Expo / React Native app. Statically parses routes and links (expo-router, react-navigation, or your own parser) for full coverage, then deep-links through every screen in the iOS simulator or Android emulator capturing screenshots — including runtime states like bottom sheet snap points and modals — and renders a self-contained HTML map. Both platforms can go into one map with a platform switcher. Also diffs two revisions into a PR preview (.diff.scrmap) showing which screens/edges were added, removed, or changed. Use when the user asks to map an Expo/React Native app's navigation, screens, or routes, wants a visual sitemap of their app, or wants to preview/review what a PR changes on-screen.

# screenmap

Produce a visual map of an Expo / React Native app's navigation: every route as a card with a screenshot, runtime state variants (bottom sheets at each snap point, modals), and navigation edges between screens.

**Arguments:** optional path to the Expo project (default: current working directory). `--static` = skip the device phases and render a screenshot-less map. `--platform ios|android|both` (default `ios`) = which device(s) to capture on. `pr <number>` or `diff <base>..<head>` = PR diff mode (see bottom).

**Working directory contract:** all outputs go to `<project>/.screenmap/out/` — `graph.json`, `screens/*.png`, `flows/*.yaml` + `flows/*.meta.json`, `map.html`. Suggest adding `.screenmap/out/` to the project's `.gitignore` at the end.

**Platform contract:** with one platform, screenshots go to `screens/<slug>.png` as they always have. With `--platform both`, they go to `screens/ios/<slug>.png` and `screens/android/<slug>.png`, `capture-status.json` is keyed by platform first (`{"android": {"<routeId>": …}}`), and the bundle carries both so the viewer gets an iOS / Android switcher. Run the device phases once per platform, all the way through, before starting the next — never interleave them.

### Device command table

Everything below that touches a device has a form per platform. `<dev>` is the iOS UDID or the Android serial (`adb devices`); with one device attached you can use `booted` on iOS and omit `-s <dev>` on Android.

| | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| list devices | `xcrun simctl list devices booted` | `adb devices -l` |
| deep link | `xcrun simctl openurl <dev> "<url>"` | `adb -s <dev> shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d '<url>'` |
| screenshot to disk | `xcrun simctl io <dev> screenshot <path>` | `adb -s <dev> exec-out screencap -p > <path>` |
| relaunch | `xcrun simctl terminate <dev> <bundleId>` then `launch` | `adb -s <dev> shell am force-stop <pkg>` then `monkey -p <pkg> -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1` |
| freeze status bar | `xcrun simctl status_bar <dev> override …` | SystemUI demo mode (see D3) |
| reach host Metro | works as-is | `adb -s <dev> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` **first**, or nothing loads |
| taps / swipes | argent (`--udid <dev>`) | argent (`--udid <dev>` — it takes an Android serial too) |

Quote the Android deep link in single quotes: `adb shell` runs the string on the device, so an unquoted `&` in a query string backgrounds the command instead of passing it.

## Flow recording (do this throughout Phases 4–5)

Every interaction sequence you perform is recorded as a **replayable flow**, written at the moment you perform it — not reconstructed afterwards. Flows use the **argent flow format** (argent.swmansion.com — Software Mansion's agentic mobile toolkit): a `<name>.yaml` argent flow plus a `<name>.meta.json` cartography sidecar, both in `<project>/.screenmap/out/flows/`. Anyone replays a flow headlessly, no LLM in the loop: `npx @swmansion/argent flow run .screenmap/out/flows/<name>.yaml`. Full pair schema: `docs/scrmap-format.md` in the skill repo.

```yaml
# Open item details and expand the sheet to 50%
steps:
  - tool: open-url
    args:
      url: "myapp://details/42"
  - wait: 1500
  # Open sheet button
  - tap: { x: 0.4975, y: 0.4691 }
  - tool: gesture-swipe
    args: { fromX: 0.4975, fromY: 0.8009, toX: 0.4975, toY: 0.4828 }
```

```json
{ "formatVersion": 2, "name": "details-sheet-50", "route": "details/[id]",
  "title": "Open item details and expand the sheet to 50%", "device": "iPhone 17 Pro",
  "steps": { "2": { "target": "Open sheet button" },
             "3": { "capture": "details_id--sheet-50.png", "note": "sheet at 50% snap" } } }
```

Rules:
- **If the argent MCP is connected, record through it** (`flow-start-recording` / `flow-add-step`): every step executes live, only successful steps are recorded, and taps get durable **selectors** instead of coordinates. Write the sidecar yourself alongside. Without argent, write the YAML directly using normalized 0–1 coordinates (device points ÷ device point-size).
- Sidecar `steps` is keyed by 0-based YAML step index. Every coordinate tap/swipe needs a `target` label (visible text or accessibility description). When a tap/swipe NAVIGATES to a different screen, set `"screen": "<route id it landed on>"` — this is how multi-screen flows stay traceable and observed edges get pinned. Screenshots are sidecar `capture` entries on the step they follow — never YAML steps.
- Add top-level `"landmarks": ["Explore", "Trending"]` — 2–5 words that are visible on the arrival screen and identify it (a title, a section header, a fixed button label; not live content). Headless replays in CI OCR the end screen and check these words to detect flow drift — without landmarks a drifted flow can only be caught heuristically.
- Simple deep-link visits from the sweep are flows too (generate them mechanically). Record dead ends you resolved with a `note`.
- Never record credentials; argent supports `{{secret:NAME}}` placeholders if input is unavoidable.

## Phase 1 — static parse

```bash
node <this skill's dir>/scripts/parse-routes.mjs <project>
```

The parser picks a **route provider** for the project — `expo-router`, `react-navigation`, or a `custom` command — and prints which one it chose and why. See `docs/route-providers.md` for the full contract.

Read the produced `<project>/.screenmap/out/graph.json` and report the summary to the user: the provider (`mode`), route count, layouts (with navigator types), edges (flag unresolved ones), routes with state hints, routes needing params, and **routes with no deep link** (`navigationOnlyRoutes`).

If the parser exits saying no provider recognised the project, or that two fit equally well, do not guess. Show the user the detection table it printed and ask which to use, then re-run with `--provider <id>`:

```bash
node <this skill's dir>/scripts/parse-routes.mjs <project> --detect          # scores only
node <this skill's dir>/scripts/parse-routes.mjs <project> --provider react-navigation
```

A project whose screens are registered somewhere none of the providers read — a generated route table, a home-grown router — is not a dead end: write a small script that emits the graph fragment documented in `docs/route-providers.md` and point `.screenmap/config.json` at it with `{"routes":{"provider":"custom","command":"…"}}`.

If `--static` was requested, jump to Phase 6.

## Phase 2 — plan params and auth

- For each route with `params`, pick a sample value: prefer concrete values found in resolved edges' `raw` hrefs (e.g. `/details/42` → `id=42`), then seed/fixture data in the repo, else `1`. Record the substitution you'll use in deep links.
- Skim the graph for routes that are likely auth-gated (segments like `(auth)`, `login`, `sign-in`, or a root layout with a redirect). Expect those to redirect during the sweep; that's fine — capture what actually renders and mark it in your report.

## Phase 3 — boot the app

Run this phase once per platform.

**iOS**

1. `xcrun simctl list devices booted` — check for a booted simulator.
2. Call the iOS simulator MCP `attach` action FIRST so the user can watch (harmless error if nothing is booted yet — boot/build, then retry attach).
3. Get the app running, preferring what already exists:
   - If Metro is already running and the app is open in the simulator, use it as-is.
   - Else start Metro in the background (`npx expo start` via background Bash from the project dir).
   - If a dev build of the app is installed on the simulator, launch it. If only Expo Go is available, open the project in it. If neither, `npx expo run:ios` (warn the user this builds and takes minutes), or fall back to web (see bottom).
4. **Verify deep linking before sweeping.** Open the root route with the scheme from `graph.json`:
   - dev build: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "<scheme>://"`
   - Expo Go: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "exp://127.0.0.1:8081/--/"`
   Take an MCP `screenshot` to confirm the app rendered (not a crash/error screen). Use whichever URL form worked for the rest of the run.

**Android**

There is no Android equivalent of the iOS simulator MCP, so the user watches the emulator window itself — say so rather than promising a live panel. The `android-debugging` skill, if available, covers adb troubleshooting in more depth.

1. `adb devices -l` — check for an attached device or a running emulator. If none, list AVDs with `emulator -list-avds` and start one in the background: `emulator -avd <name> -no-snapshot -no-boot-anim &`. If `adb`/`emulator` are not on PATH, they are under `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools` and `$ANDROID_HOME/emulator`.
2. Wait for the boot to finish — `adb wait-for-device` only waits for adb to see it, so poll until `adb shell getprop sys.boot_completed` returns `1`, then dismiss the lock screen with `adb shell input keyevent 82`. Installing before that fails in ways that read as a broken APK.
3. **`adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`.** The emulator's `localhost` is the emulator; without the tunnel the app cannot reach Metro on the host and nothing will load. Redo it after any emulator restart.
4. Get the app running: start Metro in the background as above, then launch the installed dev build (`adb shell monkey -p <pkg> -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`). If no dev build is installed, `npx expo run:android` (warn the user this builds and takes minutes).
5. **Verify deep linking before sweeping**, same as iOS: `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d '<scheme>://'`, then screenshot to disk and look at it.

## Phase 4 — route sweep

**Routes with `"reach": "navigation-only"` have no deep link at all** — normal for react-navigation screens that are absent from the linking config. Do not deep-link them and do not visit the app root in their place: that captures the home screen under the wrong route's name, which is exactly the kind of silent bad capture Phase 4b exists to catch. Skip them in this phase, record `{"needsNavigation": true}` for them in `capture-status.json`, and reach them by tapping in Phase 5b — their nav flow is their capture.

For each route with a URL (substituting params from Phase 2; for `+not-found`, deep-link a garbage path like `/definitely-not-a-route`):

1. Open the route's deep link (see the device command table).
2. Wait ~1–1.5s for the transition (MCP `wait`, or just `sleep`). Content screens that fetch over the network need 3–4s — a capture showing a spinner or loading skeleton means the wait was too short, not that the route is broken; the Phase 4b review catches these, and you re-capture with a longer wait.
3. Capture to disk at `<project>/.screenmap/out/screens/<slug>.png` (or `screens/<platform>/<slug>.png` when capturing both) — use the exact `slug` from `graph.json`; the renderer depends on this naming. (The iOS MCP `screenshot` is for your own eyes only; it doesn't save a file.)
4. Every few routes, sanity-check that you're capturing real screens — read a capture back with the Read tool, or on iOS take an MCP `screenshot`. If a route shows a red error screen, an error boundary, or redirected somewhere else, still keep the capture but note it for the final report.

### Phase 4b — review and recover (do not skip)

Error boundaries **stick**: once a bad deep link crashes a screen, subsequent deep links may render into the same error boundary, silently poisoning every capture after it. So before delivering:

1. Render a draft map (Phase 6 commands) and *look at it* — it doubles as a contact sheet of all captures.
2. Classify every capture that isn't clearly the real screen, and write the verdicts to `<project>/.screenmap/out/capture-status.json` (the renderer badges them on the map):

   ```json
   { "<routeId>": { "status": "not-found", "needsNavigation": true, "note": "why + what a future agent should do instead" } }
   ```

   Statuses: `ok` · `empty-state` · `not-found` · `error-boundary` · `loading` · `auth-wall`. Decide per capture:
   - **Loading spinner/skeleton** — wait was too short OR the param is synthetic. Re-capture with 3–4s; if still loading, the data doesn't exist → treat as not-found.
   - **Not-found / empty "Oops" screen** — your sample param doesn't resolve to real data. First try to find *real* params (public APIs, seed data, values seen in other captures — e.g. a real starter-pack rkey from the account's public profile). Only if no real value is obtainable, keep the capture, set `needsNavigation: true`, and say in the note how the screen is actually reached (opened from a shared link, requires user-owned data, etc.).
   - **Genuine empty state** — the screen rendered correctly but the account has no content (e.g. "Nothing saved yet"). That IS the screen; status `empty-state`, no `needsNavigation`. Don't confuse this with not-found.
   - **Error boundary** — the route can't render from a bare deep link at all (missing runtime params). Keep as finding, `needsNavigation: true`. Beware the **poisoned tail**: error boundaries stick, so captures taken *after* a crash may show the same stuck error — relaunch the app (`xcrun simctl terminate booted <bundleId>`, relaunch, wait for the bundle) and re-capture those.
3. Re-render after recovery.

## Phase 5 — runtime states (the part static analysis can't see)

For each route whose `stateHints` is non-empty, deep-link to it again and:

**bottom-sheet** — Read the route's source file (`file` in graph.json) to find what opens the sheet (a button whose `onPress` calls `ref.expand()` / `present()`; some sheets are open by default — check the `index` prop). Take an MCP screenshot, locate the trigger, `tap` it. Then for each snap point in the hint (e.g. `25%`, `50%`, `90%`):
- drag the sheet to that height: `swipe` from the sheet handle's current position to `y ≈ screen_height × (1 − snap)`. Start the swipe well inside the screen — a start point within 4pt of an edge triggers an OS edge gesture instead.
- capture `screens/<slug>--sheet-<value>.png` (e.g. `details_id--sheet-50.png` — strip the `%`).

**rn-modal** — find and `tap` the trigger, capture `screens/<slug>--modal.png`, then dismiss (close button, tap outside, or just deep-link away).

**router-modal** — already captured as its own route in Phase 4; nothing extra needed.

Rules for this phase:
- Re-deep-link between routes to reset state; don't let one screen's leftover state bleed into the next capture.
- Never tap destructive or irreversible controls: delete, remove, sign out, purchase, send, submit. If a sheet can only be opened via such a control, skip it and note why.
- If you type into inputs to reach a state, use obviously fake data.
- A hint is advisory — if you can't find the trigger in 2–3 attempts, skip it and note it. Also: sheets defined in shared components aren't in the hints; if you *see* an obvious sheet/modal trigger while on a screen, capture it as a bonus state.
- **The hint list is a work queue, not a suggestion box.** Phase 5 is not done until every hinted route is either captured or explicitly skipped with a reason. End the phase with a coverage line — `state hints: N routes · captured M · skipped K (list + why)` — and carry it into the Phase 6 delivery report. A state pass that quietly processes 3 of 17 hints looks complete on the map and isn't; that silence has bitten before.

## Phase 5b — navigation flows (the tap path to every screen)

Deep links are shorthands; the map's primary flow for each screen is the path a human takes. For every reachable route, record `flows/nav-<slug>.yaml` + sidecar (name `nav-<slug>`, title "Navigate to <title>") that reaches it from app launch using real taps:

- Step 1 is always `open_url` to the app root (`scheme://`) — that's the app entry, not a shortcut. Everything after is taps/swipes.
- **Every navigating tap records three things**: `coordinate` (device points), `target` (durable label), and `screen` (the route id it landed on). Verify the landing with an MCP screenshot BEFORE writing the step — a wrong `screen` poisons the graph.
- Walk the app as a tree, depth-first, reusing prefixes: e.g. record the drawer → Settings hop once, then each settings row extends it. Each flow file is still self-contained (repeats its prefix steps).
- **Transient states get captures too.** When a tap changes the UI without changing route (opens a drawer, menu, sheet), capture that state ONCE as a state variant of the source screen (`<sourceSlug>--<state>.png`, e.g. `Home--drawer.png`) and insert a screenshot step referencing it right after the opening tap in every flow that passes through it. Viewers then render the ripple for the next tap on the drawer capture instead of the closed-drawer base screen.
- End each flow with a screenshot step of the target (`<slug>.png`).
- Screens with no discoverable in-app path (deep-link-only, or requiring data the account lacks) — record that in capture-status notes instead of forcing it.

These flows are what make edges *pinnable*: a nav flow tapping through a transition tells the map viewer exactly where the trigger sits on the source screen.

## Phase 6 — pack, render, deliver

```bash
# downscale (sips is macOS; on Linux use `mogrify -resize '800x800>' <files>`)
for f in <project>/.screenmap/out/screens/*.png; do sips -Z 800 "$f" >/dev/null; done
node <this skill's dir>/scripts/pack-map.mjs <project>        # → .screenmap/out/<app>-<date>.scrmap bundle
node <this skill's dir>/scripts/render-map.mjs <project>/.screenmap/out/graph.json   # static HTML fallback
```

Capturing both platforms: downscale each `screens/<platform>/` directory, then pass the platforms to the packer — `node .../pack-map.mjs <project> --platforms ios,android`. The bundle then carries both and the viewer shows an iOS / Android switcher; report coverage per platform, since a screen can be fine on one and broken on the other.

The `.scrmap` bundle (zip: manifest.json + map.json + screens/) is the primary deliverable — see `docs/scrmap-format.md` in the skill repo. Open it in the **map viewer** (`apps/visualiser` in the skill repo, `npm run dev`, drag the bundle in): interactive graph, flow playback, click-to-copy replay commands. Send the bundle with SendUserFile; send `map.html` too as the no-tooling fallback (display: render). Report: routes captured / total, state variants captured, anything skipped (error screens, auth redirects, un-triggerable sheets), unresolved edges. Offer to publish as an Artifact (if so, load the artifact-design skill first and rebuild the page body-only per Artifact rules — don't publish the full-document HTML as-is). Suggest adding `.screenmap/out/` to `.gitignore`.

## Replay mode — `/screenmap replay <flow-name>`

Flows are argent YAML, so the primary replay is **headless**:

```bash
npx @swmansion/argent flow run <project>/.screenmap/out/flows/<flow-name>.yaml
```

Run that first (it needs no LLM and reports pass/fail per step; add `--device <id>` to pick a device, and argent takes an Android serial wherever it takes an iOS UDID). Fall back to manual replay only when argent isn't installed and can't be (`npx` unavailable) or when the flow fails and the user wants a diagnosis: execute the YAML steps yourself — `open-url`/`wait` via the device command table, taps/swipes via the simulator MCP (iOS) or `adb shell input tap <x> <y>` in device pixels (Android), using the sidecar's `target` labels as the source of truth (recorded coordinates are hints that may have drifted).

A flow recorded on one platform is not guaranteed to replay on the other: coordinates are normalized, but layouts, system chrome heights and back-navigation differ. Record per platform when you capture both, and name the platform in the sidecar's `device` field. Verify each step with an MCP screenshot; if a target can't be found in 3 attempts, stop and report which step failed and what the screen showed instead. Same safety rules as Phase 5: never trigger destructive or submitting controls.

## PR diff mode — `/screenmap pr <number>` or `/screenmap diff <base>..<head>`

Preview what a change does to the app's navigation surface: which screens were **added,
removed, or changed**, which edges appeared or vanished, with before/after screenshots.
The deliverable is a `.diff.scrmap` bundle (format: `docs/diff-scrmap-format.md` in the
skill repo) — the map viewer renders it with green/amber/red highlights, a Changes
panel, and base-vs-head comparison per screen.

Working directory: `<project>/.screenmap/out/diff/<slug>/` where slug is `pr-<number>` or
`<base>..<head>`. Verdicts are **static-only** (a screen is "changed" iff the change
set touches its file or import closure); screenshots are evidence for the reviewer,
not input to the classification.

### D1 — resolve the two revisions

- PR form: `gh pr view <n> --json number,title,url,baseRefName,headRefName,mergeCommit,files`.
  For a *merged* PR, head = the merge commit, base = its first parent (`<merge>^`).
  For an open PR, `gh pr view --json headRefOid,baseRefOid`. Write `pr.json`
  (`{number,title,url,baseSha,headSha,baseRef,headRef}`) and `changed-files.txt`
  (`gh pr diff <n> --name-only`, or `git diff --name-only <base> <head>`).
- Ref form: resolve both refs with `git rev-parse`; same files, no `number`.
- Shallow clones: `git fetch --depth 1 origin <sha>` for any SHA the repo doesn't have.
- **Native guard:** if changed files touch `ios/`, `android/`, `patches/`, or change
  native deps in `package.json`, warn the user that the installed dev build may not
  match both sides — JS-only diffs are the supported case. Proceed only if they accept.
  A change under `ios/` only affects the iOS side and one under `android/` only the
  Android side, so say which platform's captures to distrust rather than both.
- The project must have a clean tree (or the user agrees to `git stash`). Remember the
  original ref; **restore it at the end, always** — even after failures.

### D2 — parse both sides, pick suspects

```bash
git -C <project> checkout --detach <baseSha>
node <skill>/scripts/parse-routes.mjs <project>   # writes .screenmap/out/graph.json
cp <project>/.screenmap/out/graph.json <diffDir>/base/graph.json
git -C <project> checkout --detach <headSha>
node <skill>/scripts/parse-routes.mjs <project>
cp <project>/.screenmap/out/graph.json <diffDir>/head/graph.json
node <skill>/scripts/diff-map.mjs suspects <diffDir> --project <project>
```

Read `suspects.json` and report the work-list to the user before capturing: N added,
N removed, N modified (with reasons and via-files), plus any broad files excluded from
expansion. That report alone is already a useful static preview — if the user asked
for `--static`, skip to D4.

Then read the PR's actual diff for each suspect's via-files and write
`<diffDir>/notes.json` — `{ "<nodeId>": "what visibly changes on this screen" }`, one
plain sentence per suspect (e.g. "Trending topic pills become full-width ranked rows").
Viewers show this note on the screen's diff card; without it the card only says
"file-touched", which tells a reviewer nothing.

If reading the diff convinces you a statically-flagged suspect has **no visible
change** (shared import only, pure refactor, code path that doesn't render there),
use `{ "note": "why it's unaffected", "verdict": "unaffected" }` instead — pack drops
it from the changed list into `diff.json`'s `dismissed` section (omitted from the
viewer's Changes list, kept in the bundle for audit). You can also skip capturing that
screen. Dismiss only on positive evidence from the diff, not on a hunch — when unsure,
keep it and let the captures decide.

Status is tracked **per capture state**, not just per screen. When a screen's change
lives in one state (below the fold, inside a sheet), say so with per-state notes —
`""` is the bare screen, other keys are variant names:

```json
"Settings": { "note": "A 'Beta features' row is added between Languages and Help.",
  "states": {
    "": { "note": "Top of the list is identical — the row is below the fold.", "verdict": "unaffected" },
    "bottom": "New 'Beta features' row appears between Languages and Help." } }
```

The viewer marks each state in the node's dropdown (`± bottom` etc.), so capture the
state variants that make the change visible (Phase 5 style) — a diff whose change is
below the fold and has no scrolled state variant shows two identical screenshots.

### D3 — targeted capture, base then head

Boot the app (Phase 3), then freeze the status bar so both sides capture identically
(clock noise otherwise pollutes every pixel comparison):

```bash
# iOS
xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --time "9:41" --dataNetwork wifi --wifiMode active --wifiBars 3 --cellularMode active --cellularBars 4 --batteryState charged --batteryLevel 100

# Android — SystemUI demo mode is the equivalent
adb shell settings put global sysui_demo_allowed 1
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command enter
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command clock -e hhmm 0941
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command battery -e level 100 -e plugged false
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command network -e wifi show -e level 4
adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.demo -e command notifications -e visible false
```

Then for each side in order **base → head**:

1. `git checkout --detach <sha>`, restart Metro (kill the background process, start
   again), and relaunch the app; verify a deep link renders the right revision.
2. Capture only the suspect list for that side (`side: both|base` for base,
   `both|head` for head), Phase 4 style, into `<diffDir>/<side>/screens/<slug>.png`.
   Same waits, same 4b review discipline; verdicts go to
   `<diffDir>/<side>/capture-status.json`.
3. For suspects with `stateHints` — and any state the diff added (`states` with
   reason `hint`) — do a scoped Phase 5 pass so state variants land as
   `<slug>--<state>.png` on the right side.

Keep both sides comparable: same device, same account, same waits.

### D4 — pack and deliver

```bash
for f in <diffDir>/{base,head}/screens/*.png; do sips -Z 800 "$f" >/dev/null; done
node <skill>/scripts/diff-map.mjs pack <diffDir> --device "<device name>"

# both platforms: screens live at <diffDir>/<side>/screens/<platform>/, and
# --device takes one name per platform in the same order
node <skill>/scripts/diff-map.mjs pack <diffDir> --platforms ios,android --device "iPhone 17 Pro,Pixel 7"
```

Restore the original ref. Send the `.diff.scrmap` with SendUserFile; report the diff
table (added/modified/removed screens, edge changes, state changes, broad-file blind
spots, anything uncapturable). The bundle opens in the same map viewer as `.scrmap`
files (drag it in). If a full `.scrmap` of the app exists, tell the user to load both —
the map viewer overlays the diff on the full map, so unchanged screens keep their real
screenshots (dimmed) and changed screens flip base⇄head in place (hover for a red
changed-pixels render).

## Web fallback (no simulator or emulator available, or user asks for web)

- Start `npx expo start --web`, confirm `http://localhost:8081/_sitemap` lists the same routes as the parse (good cross-check).
- Capture each route that has a `urlPath` with `npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=390,844 "http://localhost:8081<urlPath>" <project>/.screenmap/out/screens/<slug>.png` (needs `npx playwright install chromium` once; ask before installing).
- State pass on web: drive the browser pane manually (tap triggers), but note playwright captures are the ones saved to disk — for sheet states, prefer `npx playwright screenshot --full-page` after using its `--wait-for-timeout` or skip and note the limitation.
